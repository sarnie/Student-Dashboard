Student-Dashboard
=================

A website where students are able to interact with their supervisors and vice versa.

- Request a meeting
- Upload a blog post
- Send an eMessage to tutor
- Upload file for review

Most of the pages use "require" to minimise code and make updates easier

- inc/model.php - Stores the class that connects to the database
- inc/controller.php - Stores all the functions
- inc/gateway.php - The function that defines if the user is a student or member of staff
- inc/header.php - Stores the generic header information that is used on every page e.g. Style sheets
